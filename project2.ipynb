    "## 1.0 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Climate Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate is characterized by long-term patterns in temperature, humidity, winds, rainfall and extreme weather frequency. Climate change refers to significant and persistent changes in the local, regional and global climate pattern (NASA, 2023b). According to United Nations (2023) and NASA (2023a), the impacts of climate change include rising sea levels, catastrophic and frequent floods and droughts and melting polar ice. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Global Warming\n",
    "Global warming is a specific aspect of climate change defined by the abnormally-accelerated increase in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activity (Riebeek, 2010). This surface temperature increase has been observed since the pre-industrial period, mostly due to greenhouse gasses from fossil fuel burning (NASA, 2023b). According to United States Environmental Protection Agency (2017), examples of greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide(N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Links Between CO<sub>2</sub>, Temperature, CH<sub>4</sub> And Precipitation In Climate Change\n",
    "\n",
    "The interrelationships between atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), temperature, and precipitation is intricate and play a vital role in the complex system of climate change. The greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>) trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere by absorbing and re-emitting infrared radiation back toward Earth's surface (www.ces.fau.edu, n.d.). This Greenhouse Effect results in a rise in average global temperatures, impacting various components of the Earth's climate system. \n",
    "\n",
    "These warmer temperatures affect the atmospheric circulation and moisture patterns through intensification of the water cycle where warmer air holds more moisture (Wikipedia, 2023). This shifts in rainfall and precipitation distribution patterns leads to intense and frequent extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall, storms, heatwaves and droughts (Understanding Global Change, n.d., Dore, 2005, www.eea.europa.eu, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes in temperature and precipitation can also create an ice-albedo feedback, where the reduction Earth's albedo (reflectivity) from ice and snow melt caused by warmer temperatures leads to more absorption of solar radiation, thus further warming the planet (CIRES Education and Outreach at CU Boulder, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.1 Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Berner (1991), atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> dictates the world climate on geological time magnitude. Results from ice-core data show that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations were significantly lower between 650kyr and 750kyr compared to the present day (Lüthi et al., 2008). A few years later, Bereiter et al. (2015) followed up with a corrected 442–816kyr portion of the EPICA Dome C CO<sub>2</sub> data.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Hertzberg and Schreuder (2016), there has been a steady increase in the average atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration from 280ppmv to 400ppmv over the last two centuries. Data from atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration collected at  at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii shows a linear trend from 315ppm in 1959 to 425ppm in 2022 (NOAA, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.2 Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "Results from high-resolution deuterium measurements of ice core data show that based on 100-year mean values over the past 800kyr, surface temperature increased ~15°C (Jouzel et al., 2007). Parrenin et al. (2013) found that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and surface air temperature move synchronously for most part from 800kyr to the present time eventhough Fischer et al. (1999), Monnin et al. (2001) and Lourantou et al. (2010) reported that atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> lags behind temperature by a few hundred years. However, Hertzberg and Schreuder (2016) noticed that temperature changes always precedes atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> changes by several hundred to a thousand years, thus suggesting that temperature change causes CO<sub>2</sub>, and not vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chen et al. (2023) reported a correlation between atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature. Earlier, Kang and Larsson (2013) reported a feedback system where temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> Granger-cause each other in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.3 Atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "Petit et al. (1999) reported that CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations follow the same trend for each glacial cycle. Monnin et al. (2001) reported that eventough the reasons behind CH<sub>4</sub> concentrations variations are different from CO<sub>2</sub>, in general, CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> increase are parallel with each other. There is also a high correlation between temperature and CH<sub>4</sub> in the past (Spahni et al., 2005). Using Granger causality analysis, temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> bidirectionally Granger-cause each other, where one's increase causes an increase in the other in a feedback system (Larsson and Persson, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.4 Irish Precipitation\n",
    "\n",
    "An analysis of a homogenized Island of Ireland Precipitation (IIP) data from 1850–2010 to study long-term rainfall series in Ireland found an increasing pattern or upward trend in the amount of precipitation (rainfall or snowfall) during the winter months, while a negative or decreasing pattern was found in the amount of precipitation during the summer months (Noone et al., 2016). \n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term air temperature series data for Ireland between 1831-1968 was reconstructed by Mateus, Potito and Curley (2020) and between 1885–2018 (Mateus and Potito, 2021). Subsequent analysis between 1885 to 2018 found significant air temperature increase in all seasons, especially spring and autumn and significant air temperature decrease during cold days, cold nights and frost days (Mateus and Potito, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Later, Murphy et al. (2023a) found that Dublin-based stations show a maximum increase of 1.14°C in the annual mean temperature for every 1°C increase in the global mean surface temperature and increase in extremely heavy rainfall were recorded for 30% of stations. Such temperature increase would result in higher a risk of river and groundwater flooding in Ireland (Murphy et al., 2023b)."
